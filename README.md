### Roboto
The Roboto font is a sans-serif typeface that is clean, modern, and highly readable. It is used extensively in this project to ensure that the text is easily legible across various devices and screen sizes. The font's balanced character shapes and open curves make it a great choice for both body text and headings.

To use this font in your project, you can include it in your CSS file as follows:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap');

body {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
